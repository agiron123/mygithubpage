As a developer, I spend most of my time in the terminal and my IDE. Naturally, if I were to have a blog of sorts,
I would definitely prefer to have my workflow be based off of the tools that I use and interact with the most.

I've set up this blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It's pretty sweet.

This post will go through my content creation process from ideation to writing, to editing and eventually publishing this very
blog post. We will follow the github workflow all the way though and apply it to writing.

Step 1: Ideation

In Github, most ideas and feature requests for a project start out as an issue. This blog is no different.

First, we'll create an issue about this very post.

TODO: Add image of issue here.

Step 2: Write!

Now for the hardest part, actually putting down words on paper, or in my case firing up Visual Studio code and writing this post.

Step 3: Pull Request Time

Being able to issue a Pull Request is super powerful, as you can review your writing, leave comments and edit as needed.
What's super interesting about this process is that it scales and a team can actually work together and edit eachothers work on a blog just like a code review.

To make the Github Pages work successfully, a pull request should be issued to the branch set up to publish the post. In my case,
that's branch is gh-pages.

Step 4 Publish:

Since I've done all the hard work and set everything up properly, publishing a blog post is as simple as merging the pull request that we've created. Once that Pull request is merged into the gh-pages branch, we're good to go!

I hope you've enjoyed my quick overview of how the publishing process on this blog works!

Looking forwards to seeing your blogging workflows if you use a static site generator like Jekyll / Gatsby / Hugo.
