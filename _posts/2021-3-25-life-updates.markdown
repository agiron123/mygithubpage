It has been a while since I have posted an update on my life here.

Over the past year, there have been some exciting changes in my life!
This post will likely become the ```/now``` page of my website.

Here's what I'm currently up to:
-Moved from Atlanta to San Francisco.
-Spent quarantine in San Francisco.
I know! Perfect timing!
-Started a new job at withjoy.com
I've joined the awesome team at withjoy.com and now work on the growth team.
My team is responsible for the withjoy.com website before you log into the app and has
built quite an awesome website if I do say so myself. Check it out and let me know what you think.
-Celebrated my 1 year anniversary at withjoy.com
I can't believe it's been a year already, but I've been working a year at Joy as a full time employee. Prior to being a full time employee at Joy, I worked with the team at Joy for about six months as a contractor.

Other fun stuff:
-I've been together with my girlfriend Korie for four years now.
-We've got two corgis too! Elton and Freddie. I can't tell who I love more, Korie or the dogs :) Just kidding, I love Korie a whole lot and she means the world to me. Elton and Freddie are amazing doggos as well. Both Korie and the dogs bring great joy to my life.
-Right before moving to San Francisco, I got really into fishkeeping.
I had a reef tank (Red Sea Reefer 170), and had a really awesome coral reef at home. Unfortunately I had to tear down my tank to move across the country. It's still in storage in Atlanta, and will be put to use as soon as I can do so out here.

Computers:
-I've got a lot of them. Since I work in tech, they bring a lot of value to my life and I'm always happy to purchase a nice machine for myself. I'm currently writing this piece on my new M1 Macbook, which is amazing. More on the laptop later, but I'm sure you've probably seen a ton of awesome blog posts about it by now.
-Current hardware inventory consists of:
    -2020 Apple M1 Macbook Pro
        -16GB RAM
        -512 GB SSD
        This thing flies and stays cool as the other side of the pillow when in use. I can actually use it on my lap unlike my 2019 Macbook Pro.
    -2019 Macbook Pro
        -32GB RAM
        -512 GB SSD
        -Intel i9 chip
        This machine was provided by my employer and it's an awesome machine. Has a lot of power, and has put up with 40+ hours of use every week no problem.
    -2016 Macbook Pro
        -i7 chip
        -16GB RAM
        -512 GB SSD
        This machine has kicked ass for many years and is now starting to show it's age. I've replaced it with my M1 Macbook pro and need to find it a new home soon.
    -Ryzen 7 Desktop - Ryzen 1700x CPU
        -16GB RAM
        -1TB SSD
        -2 4TB HDD
        -G Force GTX 1080
            -I really want a new GPU, but they're super hard to find now!
        -various other small SSDs that I use to boot into linux and what not occasionally.
    -Acer Predator Helios 300
        -i7 Chip
        -16GB RAM
        -G Force GTX 1050
        -1TB SSD
        -1TB HDD
        I love my Predator. It's great for gaming on the go and is a nice compomise of size and power as a laptop. Originally I bought this to be used as a Streaming PC, but I've found that it does just fine on it's own as a gaming computer and has been used in several get togethers when gaming at friends' houses.
