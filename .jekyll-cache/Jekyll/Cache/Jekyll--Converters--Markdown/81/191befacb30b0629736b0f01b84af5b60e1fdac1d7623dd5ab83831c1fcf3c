I"—<p>GitHub Codespaces are finally out of beta and Iâ€™m super excited to be able to try them out in my day to day workflow.</p>

<p>So far, being able to click on a repository, spin up a development environment and be able to start coding right away is pretty amazing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using the 13â€™ Macbook Pro as my daily driver for a while now and have been wanting to blog a bit about my experience with the device. Ironically, the program that Iâ€™ve struggled to run the most powers this very blog â€“ jekyll.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t until today, where I was bored on a Saturday morning during a holiday weekend that I decided to give Codespaces a try.</p>
