I"Ù<p>Writing sucks. I have all these great ideas in my head, but can never seem to get them out on paper.</p>

<p>When I finally do sit down to write, I choke and freeze up on the keyboard, or forget how to use a pen entirely.
Iâ€™ve been spending a lot of time thinking about this, and why the creative process can be a little tough for me.
As a software developer, I actually do a ton of creative type work, so getting into the flow and slinging lots of code and
eventually putting together a kickass product is nothing new to me. So why is writing so hard?</p>

<p>The answer is actually pretty simple. I code every day all day. Yet I donâ€™t write every day.</p>

<p>The difference between my coding and writing is just consistency. Iâ€™ve invested thousands of hours to hone in my craft as a programmer, yet I cannot say the same about writing.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s to starting to write more regularly and consistently creating. I hope that you can join me on this journey as well.</p>
