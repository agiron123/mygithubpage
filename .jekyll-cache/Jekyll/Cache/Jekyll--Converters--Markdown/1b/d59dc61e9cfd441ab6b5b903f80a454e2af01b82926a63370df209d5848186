I"S<p>GitHub Codespaces are finally out of beta and I’m super excited to be able to try them out in my day to day workflow.</p>

<p>So far, being able to click on a repository, spin up a development environment and be able to start coding right away is pretty amazing.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the 13’ Macbook Pro as my daily driver for a while now and have been wanting to blog a bit about my experience with the device. Ironically, the program that I’ve struggled to run the most powers this very blog – jekyll.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until today, where I was bored on a Saturday morning during a holiday weekend that I decided to give Codespaces a try. After struggling for a while to get my Macbook to work with my blog, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Codespaces worked with one click and even included Jekyll installed by default!</p>
