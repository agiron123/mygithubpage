    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a Software Developer and am located in the Atlanta area.
    I am currently looking for a job when I graduate from Georgia Tech.
    </p>
    <p>I have a strong interest in game development and mobile developmnet.
      An ideal job for me would allow me to pursue my two interests.
      I am very user focused when it comes to creating software. User experience
      is something that I care deeply about. An ideal role for me would allow me
      to write code and have some influence in the user experience.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
    <p>Great question. Allow me to sell myself to you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am passionate about software development and driven to succeed.</li>
        <li>I constantly strive to better myself. Not just in software development,
        but in all aspects of my life.</li>
        <li>I am a team player.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>What are you looking for in your career?</h2>
    <p>I get this question a lot in interviews.</p>

    <p>I want to work on something that matters. I want to do something challenging every day.
      I want to never stop improving at my craft, and I want to be able to help others along the
      way on my journey.</p>

    <p>Hopefully I can find a work place that allows me to do those things.</p>

    <p>I currently do not have a final destination in mind for my career.
      I don't think that I need to have it all figured out yet. The adventure is part of the fun.
      I am adventurous, and hope that I will be able to stay that way throughout my entire career.
      I just hope that the first part of my career can be as awesome as possible.</p>
