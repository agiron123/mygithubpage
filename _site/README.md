README
Source code for http://andregiron.me

This Github page is a jekyll blog which serves as my personal website as well
as my blog. More good stuff to come here! Eventually, I do plan on creating some
sort of dynamic page for myself, but for now, this is good enough.

Contact me if you have any questions.
